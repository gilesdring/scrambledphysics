<p>ScrambledPhysics is a simple physics engine written in 100% native <a href="http://processing.org/" title="Link to Processing website">Processing</a>.
The aim of the project is to create a portable (within Processing) library which is good enough for basic physics simulations.</p>

<p>The example above should give you an idea of what it can do. This is
simulating 100 charged particles (some positive, some negative), with an
initial velocity of zero and a random placement within the universe, which is
640 x 480 pixels in size. When a particle reaches the edge, it wraps around.</p>

<h1>Installation</h1>

<ol>
<li>Get the code by either

<ul>
<li>Cloning the git repository to a directory</li>
<li>Downloading the zip file</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Open Processing and create a new project (called anything
<em>EXCEPT</em> <code>ScrambledPhysics</code>
</li>
<li>From the command line, Finder, Explorer or whatever, copy / link
the file <code>ScrambledPhysics.pde</code> into the new Processing directory.</li>
<li>Build your universe...</li>
</ol><h1>Key Concepts</h1>

<h2>Universe</h2>

<p>Every simulation has a universe. Universes have laws and things added to them.</p>

<h2>Laws</h2>

<p>Laws affect the universe simulation. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gravity - apply a force to every particle in the universe in proportion
to its mass, and in the direction Gravity is pointing.</li>
<li>Coulomb - apply a force to every particle based on its charge, and the
charges of every other particle in the system.</li>
</ul><h2>Things</h2>
