This gives an idea of what can be done with a very small amount of
development with ScrambledPhysics. The universe and an Emitter are
defined in <code><a href="CERN.pde">CERN.pde</a></code>, and the
simulation runs. The Emitter randomly adds particles to a point in
the universe with a random velocity.
