Get the code by either\r\n   * Cloning the git repository to a directory\r\n   * Downloading the zip file\r\n2. Open Processing and create a new project (called anything\r\n   *EXCEPT* `ScrambledPhysics`\r\n3. From the command line, Finder, Explorer or whatever, copy / link\r\n   the file `ScrambledPhysics.pde` into the new Processing directory.\r\n4. Build your universe...\r\n\r\n# Key Concepts\r\n\r\n## Universe\r\n\r\nEvery simulation has a universe. Universes have laws and things added to them.\r\n\r\n## Laws\r\n\r\nLaws affect the universe simulation. Some examples include:\r\n\r\n* Gravity - apply a force to every particle in the universe in proportion\r\n  to its mass, and in the direction Gravity is pointing.\r\n* Coulomb - apply a force to every particle based on its charge, and the\r\n  charges of every other particle in the system.\r\n\r\n## Things\r\n\r\n### Particle\r\n","google":"","name":"Scrambledphysics","tagline":"Simple physics library for the Processing language, written in pure processing, in a single file."}
